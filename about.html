    <h1>About Francisco</h1>
<p>
Born in Argentina and raised in Miami, I come from a humble, hardworking background as part of a proud, tight-knit family. 
As the first in my family on the path to becoming a college graduate, I’m driven by a strong work ethic and the desire to make a lasting impact. 
Since the age of 16, I’ve honed my interpersonal skills in the hospitality industry, which has shaped me into an outgoing self-starter 
with a passion for collaborating in a team. I am deeply curious about the world, with a love for learning new cultures, traveling, and exploring history. 
In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, immersing myself in soccer—both as a player and a fan—and connecting with others. 
Now, I am eager to bring my unique perspective and drive to the growing tech industry, where I aspire to contribute to meaningful projects and be part of the dynamic, evolving landscape.
